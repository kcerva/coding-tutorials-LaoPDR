## Getting familiar with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook is a simple integrated development environment (IDE). It can also be described as a program that allows you to edit, run and document code (in Python and other languages). Important things to know about Jupyter Notebooks:
  - The notebook is a series of *cells*, which contain code and show the results below
  - You need to step through the cells running them in sequence, using either the "play" button on the toolbar, or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
  - You can edit the code and run the cell again to see the effect of changes
  - The history of code that you've run accumulates from cell to cell, but you can reset to a clean slate by restarting the "kernel" from the menubar

Jupyter Notebook is included in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

You can improve the visual layout of the Jupyter Notebook by using the package [**nbextension**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). For example, this adds a table of Contents to your Notebook.
